This approach is flexible and powerful and can be adapted to many machine learning algorithms, including:

ðŸ”¹ Neural Networks (fully connected / dense)

Like the one you're building now.

With any number of layers, sizes, and activation functions.

ðŸ”¹ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

You'd just replace dense layers with tf.nn.conv2d, tf.nn.max_pool, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs)

Can be built using tf.nn.rnn_cell.* modules or tf.nn.dynamic_rnn.

ðŸ”¹ Autoencoders

Same structure, with output layer matching input size.

ðŸ”¹ Binary or Multi-Class Classification

Just adjust the output size and activation/loss function.

ðŸ”¹ Regression Problems
